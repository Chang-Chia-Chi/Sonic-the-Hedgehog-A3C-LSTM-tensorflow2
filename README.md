## Introduction
This project implement **Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) with LSTM cell** to train an agent playing Sonic-the-Hedgehog    
Model is built by using **tensorflow2-keras** in python.

## How to start

## Training

## Test
`P.S. Uploaded weights are trained by using *Impala CNN* model.`
